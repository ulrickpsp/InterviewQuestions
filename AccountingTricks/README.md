# ACCOUNTING TRICKS

  ```
  
A company focused on building blocks so that the snake from 'SnakeMovement' example can move, keeps track of their
movements for each year. They think it's a good thing to make up the numbers so they're never in negative numbers.

Let's say they provide us the following list of movements:

  movements = [10, -10, 20, -30, -40, 70, -25, 30, 50]

We're allowed to push any movement to the end to achieve the goal of maintaining a balance greater or equal to 0
Asume that the sum of all movements is always greater than 0
They ask us which is the minimum number of movements needed to achieve this goal

So, in this example we would end up having this list:

  output = [10, -10, 20, 70, -25, 30, 50, -30, -40]
  Movements = 2
  
  ```
