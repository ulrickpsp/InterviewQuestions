# SORTING SUBLIST

```
Given an unsorted array A find a sublist so that if we sorted this sublist the whole list would be sorted.
Return the starting index and end index of the sublist.

For example if A = {0, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3, 1, 9, 13, 24, 31, 47 ,52}
If we sorted the sublist (3, 7, 5, 3, 1, 9) -> (1, 3, 3, 5, 7, 9)
Then, the whole list would be sortered {0, 1 (1, 3, 3, 5, 7, 9), 13, 24, 31, 47 ,52}

So the indexes we're looking for are 2 and 7
