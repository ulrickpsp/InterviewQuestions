Check if sequence is a sublist of array
True; if every integer in sequence is present in array maintaining the same order
False; otherwise

Example 1:

    array = [1, 3, 4, 16, 24, 5]
    sequence = [1, 4, 24]
    output = True

Example 2:

    array = [1, 3, 4, 16, 24, 5]
    sequence = [1, 4, 25]
    output = False
